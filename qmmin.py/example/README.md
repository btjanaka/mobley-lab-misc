# Example of QMMin.py

This directory shows the results of a sample run of qmmin.py. It takes the
results stored in output.dat and extracts the final optimized geometry and
energy to the file output.sdf. This example was generated by running the
following command from the qmmin.py directory:
```
qmmin.py example/output.dat example/output.sdf
```
