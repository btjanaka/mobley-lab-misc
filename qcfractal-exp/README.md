# QCFractal Exp

Attempts to use QCFractal to run QM calculations on molecules with trivalent
nitrogens.

## Manifest

- `data/small-set.smi`: These molecules originate in eMolecules. Each one has a
  single trivalent nitrogen; they were generated by running
  [DANCE](https://github.com/btjanaka/dance) on eMolecules and selecting a
  coarse rounding (0.50 and 0.50) in DANCE-select.
- `notebooks/send_mols_to_server.ipynb`: Scratch space for figuring out how to
  query the QCFractal server.
- `scripts/smi_to_sdf.py`: A small tool for converting molecules from SMILES to SDF to
  they can be used in the QM calculations.
